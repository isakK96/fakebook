This is a facebook clone made using Ruby on Rails.
It was made as part of the Odin Project curriculum found [here.](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/final-project)

Users can create, like, and comment on posts as well as add other users as friends.
It is currently missing a fair amount of functionality, such as notifications and being able to upload your own profile picture.
